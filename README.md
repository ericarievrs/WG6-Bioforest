WG6 - "climate anomalies" is a sub-project of the Bioforest project aimed at studying the effect of climate anomalies on tree growth (AGB change) on control and selective logged plots in interaction with functional traits. Main hypothesis: Forest management such as selective logging and thinning has long-lasting effects on forest
composition, diversity and structure which may alter forest resistance and resilience to extreme climate events (disturbed forests host more light-demanding tree species, and these fast-growing species may be more sensitive to climate extremes).
